Creating a to-do list with HTML, CSS, and JS involves using HTML to structure the list items, CSS to style the layout and appearance, and JavaScript to add interactivity. HTML defines the list with checkboxes and input fields for tasks. CSS styles the list's appearance, such as fonts and colors. JavaScript adds functionality like adding, removing, and marking tasks as complete. The combination of these three technologies allows users to easily manage and organize their tasks on a web page.
