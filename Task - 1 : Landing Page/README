Task Explanation : 

Creating a landing page with HTML and CSS entails creating a web page that serves as the visitor's first point of contact. The content is structured using HTML, which includes headings, paragraphs, images, and links. 
CSS is then used to style the page, allowing you to control the fonts, colors, layout, and overall visual presentation.A landing page typically contains a compelling headline, a clear call-to-action button, and relevant imagery. 
You can also include navigation links and a footer to provide a complete user experience. HTML provides the structure, while CSS improves the aesthetics and usability of the page. By effectively combining these two technologies, you can create an engaging and visually appealing landing page that will capture the attention of your audience and encourage them to take the desired action.
